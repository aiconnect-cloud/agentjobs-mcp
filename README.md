# Agent Jobs MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI agents to query and manage jobs in the Agent Jobs system of the AI Connect platform.

## About Agent Jobs

Agent Jobs is a robust asynchronous task management system on the AI Connect platform, enabling the creation, monitoring, and execution of jobs across different platforms like Slack and WhatsApp, with support for scheduled execution, automatic retries, and timeout handling. The Agent Jobs manipulation API provides endpoints to create, list, query, and cancel jobs, allowing developers and external systems to easily integrate asynchronous processing functionalities into their applications, automating complex workflows without the need to implement the entire task management infrastructure.

## Features

This MCP Server provides tools for AI agents to:

- üìã **List Jobs**: Query all jobs with advanced filtering
- üîç **Get Specific Job**: Retrieve details of a specific job by ID
- ‚úÖ **Create Jobs**: Create new jobs for immediate or scheduled execution
- ‚ùå **Cancel Jobs**: Cancel running or scheduled jobs
- üìä **Monitor Status**: Track job status (WAITING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED)

## Technologies

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by Anthropic
- **Zod** for schema validation
- **AI Connect API** for integration with the Agent Jobs system

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agentjobs-mcp
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables (Optional):**

The MCP server comes with default values from `.env-example`, so you can run it without setting any environment variables. However, you **must** provide an API key for authentication.

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
DEFAULT_ORG_ID=your-organization     # Default: aiconnect
AICONNECT_API_KEY=your-api-key       # Required: Must be provided
AICONNECT_API_URL=https://api.aiconnect.cloud/api/v0  # Default
```

**Important**: If no environment variables are provided, the server will use these defaults:
- `DEFAULT_ORG_ID`: `aiconnect`
- `AICONNECT_API_URL`: `https://api.aiconnect.cloud/api/v0`
- `AICONNECT_API_KEY`: empty (must be provided for API calls to work)

4. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Configuration Options

This MCP server is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration. It uses a smart fallback system:

1. **With environment variables**: Full control over all settings
2. **Without environment variables**: Uses defaults from `.env-example`
3. **Partial configuration**: Mix of environment variables and defaults

**Default Values (when no env vars are set):**
- `DEFAULT_ORG_ID`: `"aiconnect"`
- `AICONNECT_API_URL`: `"https://api.aiconnect.cloud/api/v0"`
- `AICONNECT_API_KEY`: `""` (empty - you must provide this)

**Error Handling:**
- If `AICONNECT_API_KEY` is not provided, tools will return helpful error messages
- If `AICONNECT_API_URL` is not set, it defaults to the production API
- If `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` is not set, it defaults to "aiconnect"

### Running the MCP server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start and wait for connections via stdio transport.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/agentjobs-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DEFAULT_ORG_ID": "your-organization",
        "AICONNECT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "AICONNECT_API_URL": "https://api.aiconnect.cloud/api/v0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
